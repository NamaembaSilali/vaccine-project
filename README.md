![Vaccine](image.jpg)

#### PROJECT OVERVIEW
The goal of this project is to predict whether individuals received the H1N1 flu vaccine based on data collected from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey. By analyzing various features from the dataset, we aim to build a predictive model that can identify the likelihood of someone having received the H1N1 vaccine. This information is valuable for public health officials seeking to understand vaccine uptake patterns and tailor future vaccination campaigns.

#### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Given a dataset containing demographic, behavioral, and opinion-related information from respondents of the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey, the task is to develop a predictive model to determine whether a respondent received the H1N1 flu vaccine. This is a binary classification problem where the target variable is the receipt of the H1N1 vaccine, categorized as either 'Yes' or 'No'.

The dataset includes various features such as age, gender, income level, health status, exposure risk, and attitudes towards vaccination. The challenge lies in effectively utilizing these features to build a robust model that can accurately classify respondents based on their likelihood of having received the vaccine.

Key objectives include:

Feature Selection and Engineering: Identifying which features are most predictive of vaccine receipt and transforming raw data into meaningful attributes that enhance model performance.
Model Selection: Comparing different classification algorithms (e.g., logistic regression and decision trees) to find the most effective approach.
Performance Evaluation: Assessing the modelâ€™s accuracy, precision, recall, and overall effectiveness using appropriate metrics and validation techniques to ensure reliability and generalizability.
Interpretability: Providing insights into how different features contribute to the predictions, which can be valuable for understanding vaccination behavior and informing public health strategies.
The ultimate goal is to create a model that not only predicts vaccine receipt with high accuracy but also offers actionable insights for public health officials to target and improve vaccination efforts, potentially reducing the impact of future flu pandemics.

#### DATA UNDERSTANDING
This particular dataset is part of a competition designed to predict flu vaccination patterns, drawing from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey. The data includes comprehensive details about survey respondents, encompassing their health behaviors, opinions on flu vaccines, and demographic information.
The dataset includes various features related to respondents' backgrounds and behaviors. Key aspects of the dataset may include:
Demographic Information: Age, gender, education level, income, etc.
Health Behaviors: General health status, history of vaccination, frequency of healthcare visits, etc.
Opinions and Attitudes: Attitudes towards vaccines, perceived risk of flu, etc.
Target Variable: H1N1 Vaccine Receipt: Binary variable indicating whether the respondent received the H1N1 vaccine (1 for Yes, 0 for No).

#### DATA PREPROCESSING
The data preprocessing steps will include:
Handling missing values: We will use imputation techniques to replace missing values with suitable alternatives.
Data normalization: We will normalize the data to ensure that all features are on the same scale, which is essential for many machine learning algorithms.
Feature scaling: We will scale the data to have zero mean and unit variance, which is a common practice in machine learning.

#### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS.
Performing EDA to ;
1. EDA provides an opportunity to dive into your dataset, allowing you to grasp its structure, features, and the various types of data it contains. This step lays the groundwork for your entire analysis process.

2. Distribution Analysis: Through EDA, you can examine how your variables are distributed, whether they follow a normal distribution, show skewness, or contain outliers, giving you insights into potential hurdles or adjustments needed in your analysis.
3. Data Visualization: EDA is a powerful tool for visualizing data
4. Data Quality Check: EDA helps you identify any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values in the data

#### MODELLING
The modelling step will involve the following steps:
1. Model Selection: This involves selecting the best model for the problem at hand.
2. Model Training: This involves training the selected model on the training data.
3. Model Evaluation: This involves evaluating the performance of the trained model on the test data.

The models used include:
1. Logistic Regression that had an Accuracy of 0.85 meaning that 85% of the samples were correctly classified, Precision: 69% of the samples predicted as positive were actually positive, Recall: 51% of the actual positive samples were correctly predicted.
F1-score: The model's overall performance is considered moderate, balancing precision and recall.

2. Decision Trees that had an accuracy of 78% performing poorer than the baseline model: logistic regression. The decision tree with polynomial features also exhibited a cross validation score of 0.78.

#### RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Hyperparameter Tuning: Conduct a more thorough hyperparameter optimization process to identify the optimal values for parameters such as regularization strength, learning rate, and number of iterations.
2. Feature Engineering: Explore creating new features or transforming existing ones to better capture relevant patterns and improve predictive power.
3. Collecting more upto date data.
4. Model Selection: Consider alternative models, such as Random Forest.

#### NEXT STEPS

1. Continuous Monitoring: Implement a system to monitor the model's performance in a production environment and identify any degradation over time.
2. Retraining: Regularly retrain the model on new data to ensure it remains accurate and up-to-date.
3. urther analysis to determine the specific features that affect the vaccination of individuals
4. Deployment of the best performing model
